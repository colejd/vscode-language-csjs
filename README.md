> A CSJS syntax highlighter for Visual Studio Code.

![Example](/assets/example.png)

## Introduction

[CSJS](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs) is a JavaScript library that lets you write inline CSS in your JavaScript code. The CSS goes in a string, however, so you don't get any syntax highlighting. This extension adds regular CSS highlighting inside any CSJS block.

## Installation

You can find it on the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) under the name `CSJS Syntax Highlighter`.

## Usage

This extension will automatically highlight any file with the extension `.csjs.js`. You can also use `Change Language Mode` from the Command Palette to set the mode manually.

## License

MIT license. See [LICENSE](/license) for more details.
